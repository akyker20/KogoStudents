KogoStudents
================

Kogo is an advertising service for local businesses targeting colleged-age consumers.

This is one of three applications to make it easier for us, our clients, and our employees.

This is a python web application built on Django that will allow college students and our drivers
to communicate. Students will be able to request rides from certain locations on campus to
locations nearby. Requests involving the same route are grouped to maxmimize profitability. 
Drivers are alerted of these ride groups and will proceed to their pickup location.
